# mariner: the gen3 workflow engine
A "workflow" is a partially ordered set of computations, where the output of one step may be input for another step. Workflows are written in a workflow language, such as [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/). In order to execute a workflow, you must pass it to some workflow engine to parse the workflow and actually perform the computations. mariner is a workflow engine for gen3.
